=======

Tipping feature, using Bitcoins as a micro-transaction platform.

**demo:**

If a user encounters content online (blog post, video, music, book) that is insightful delightful, she/he can "tip" the author (~ a penny, for instance) to show appreciation. Essentially a "Like" with a micro-payment attached.
