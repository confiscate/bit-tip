bit-tip
=======

## Note: code is Horribly copy/pasted. Intended to be a one-off UX mock only!

UX mock for a tipping feature idea, using Bitcoins as a micro-transaction platform.

**demo:**
http://www.whatnotlist.com/cointip/tip.html

If a user encounters content online (blog post, video, music, book) that is insightful delightful, she/he can "tip" the author (~ a penny, for instance) to show appreciation. Essentially a "Like" with a micro-payment attached.
